## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-20

### Tools — LLM robustness and mount extensions

New mount-time options for real-world LLM tool usage.

- **JSON coercion for tool arguments.** `coerceJsonArgs` (default `true`) on
  `mountAgent` / `mountMcp` / `createMcpHandler` — LLMs that double-serialize
  arrays/objects (sending `"[1,2]"` instead of `[1,2]`) no longer hit validation
  errors. New public `withJsonCoercion()` helper.
- **Discriminated union flatten for MCP.** `flattenUnionInput` on mount configs
  flattens a `z.discriminatedUnion` into a single `z.object` with an enum
  discriminator — MCP tools with variant inputs (patch operations) register
  instead of being rejected. New public `flattenDiscriminatedUnion()` helper.
- **Global error hints.** `errorHint` callback on mount configs — inject a
  recovery hint into every failed tool result (e.g. "try a different approach").
  Combined with per-error `AppError.hint` when both are present.
- **Tool manifest for deferred tools.** `buildToolManifest(tools)` produces a
  searchable `{ name, description, inputSchema }[]` from `collectTools()` — the
  primitive for building a `tool_search` native tool. `collectTools` and
  `MountableTool` are now public exports.

### Runtime-agnostic core

The core is now Web Fetch-clean — `createHandler` has no Bun globals. Node ≥ 22
is a supported runtime.

- **`stitchkit/node` subpath.** `serveNode(config)` runs the same `createHandler`
  on Node via [`srvx`](https://srvx.h3.dev). One contract, one `implement()`,
  one set of handlers — different import for the server bootstrap.
- **Type split.** `ServerConfig` is replaced by `HandlerConfig` (runtime-neutral,
  used by `createHandler`) and `BunServerConfig` (extends `HandlerConfig` with
  Bun-specific fields, used by `createServer`).
- **`new URL` fallback.** `createHandler` passes a base to `new URL(req.url)` so
  Node adapters that supply only a pathname no longer throw.
- **New exports from `stitchkit/node`:** `serveNode`, `NodeServerConfig`,
  `NodeServerHandle`, `createHandler`, `HandlerConfig`.
- **New exports from `stitchkit/server`:** `HandlerConfig`, `BunServerConfig`.
- `engines` in `package.json` now declares `node: ">=22"` alongside
  `bun: ">=1.2.0"`. `srvx` is an optional peer dependency.
- CI runs a Node 22 smoke test against the built `dist/`.

### ADR split

- Architecture decisions moved from a single `docs/DECISIONS.md` into individual
  files under `docs/decisions/` (one per ADR). New: ADR 0013 (runtime-agnostic
  core).

### Tools — tool-surface integrity

A pass over the MCP / agent layer to close the cases where a tool surface
silently diverged from the HTTP contract.

- **MCP tools fail loud on an incompatible schema.** A tool whose schema cannot
  be represented as JSON Schema (a `z.date()`, a `z.map()`, …) no longer
  vanishes from the surface with a `console.error`. `mountMcp` /
  `buildMcpServer` / `createMcpHandler` take `onIncompatibleSchema:
  'throw' | 'skip' | 'warn'` (default `'throw'`), and `createMcpHandler`
  validates a static `services` array at construction — a failed deploy, not a
  lost tool. New `validateMcpSchemas()` runs the same check on its own.
- **One Zod → JSON Schema conversion point** (`tools/json-schema.ts`) — the
  build-time validity probe now uses the same converter direction (`io`) the
  transport SDKs emit with, so it tests what is actually shipped.
- **Tool arguments are validated by the schema the tool advertises.** The
  advertised schema is no longer coerced or discriminated-union-flattened away
  from the schema used to validate a call — `withJsonCoercion` and the lossy
  union flatten are gone. An agent tool advertises a union / discriminated
  union natively; an MCP tool needs an object input (the MCP surface cannot
  advertise a top-level union), so a non-object input is reported through
  `onIncompatibleSchema` rather than shipped as an empty schema.
- **Tool calls parse params and input over disjoint argument slices**, like the
  HTTP transport — a `.strict()` contract schema now works as a tool.
- **Tool calls run a `beforeHandle` / `afterHandle` lifecycle.** `mountMcp`,
  `mountAgent`, `buildMcpServer` and `createMcpHandler` take a `lifecycle` —
  pass the same `createAuthHook` result used for the HTTP `beforeHandle` and
  tool calls are scope-guarded identically (previously a tool call bypassed it).
- **A tool's handler output is validated against the contract** (an
  `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` on mismatch), as on HTTP.
- **A non-object `output` still yields `structuredContent`** — it is wrapped in
  `{ result: … }` for the MCP structured payload.
- **Cross-service tool-name collisions throw** in `mountMcp` / `mountAgent`.
- `mountAgent` now also accepts `ServiceDef | ServiceDef[]` (`mountMcp` already did).
- `defineContract` rejects an empty `desc` and a `toolName` on an endpoint not
  exposed on any tool transport.
- New exports from `stitchkit/tools`: `validateMcpSchemas`,
  `IncompatibleSchemaPolicy`, `ToolLifecycle`, `ToolCallHooks`, `ToolResult`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-20

First public release.

### Contract

- `defineContract(meta, endpoints)` — one declaration describing an API: method,
  path, Zod `input` / `output` / `params`, `scope`, `expose` transports,
  `multipart`, per-endpoint `timeout`.
- `AppError` + `notFound` / `badRequest` / `unauthorized` / `forbidden` /
  `conflict` / `rateLimited` / `appError` — a single error model. `ErrorEnvelope`
  is the one error-response shape, shared by the server and the typed client.
- `paginatedSchema()` / `Paginated<T>` — the cursor-pagination envelope.

### HTTP server

- `createServer()` / `createHandler()` — HTTP on `Bun.serve()`, no HTTP
  framework dependency. Route groups, lifecycle hooks, raw routes, CORS,
  request logging, trace ids.
- `implement()` / `createImplement<Ctx>()` — type-safe handler binding.
- `createAuthHook()` / `createBearerResolver()` — scope-aware auth derived
  from `contract.scope`.
- `streamSSE()` / `parseSSE()`, `parseMultipart()`, `createRateLimiter()`,
  `createCache()`, `createEventBus<EventMap>()`.

### MCP & AI agents

- `createMcpHandler()` — a full MCP Streamable-HTTP server from contracts; the
  consuming app never imports `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- `createStdioMcpServer()` — serve contract tools over the **stdio** transport,
  as a subprocess of the MCP client. `buildMcpServer()` is the transport-neutral
  core shared by both MCP transports.
- `mountMcp()` mounts contract tools onto an existing server; `mountAgent()`
  produces Vercel AI SDK tools. `ToolExtend` adds host-supplied arguments.
- `implementRemote(contract, http)` — bind a contract to a remote HTTP API, for
  building a thin local MCP / agent server. Optional `transformArgs` hook.
- `instructions` on the MCP server config — a host-facing usage hint, surfaced
  to MCP tool-search.
- MCP tools register an `outputSchema` (from the contract `output`) and return
  `structuredContent` — the structured payload consumed by MCP App UIs.

### Observability

- `stitchkit/observability` — the audit layer above the raw hooks. A project's
  request logging becomes a table plus a `write` function.
- `createAuditHook({ write, filter?, sanitize? })` — wires the HTTP fetch
  handler and the `afterToolCall` hook into one sink, normalising every
  completed call into a `RequestEvent`.
- `wrapInRequestContext` + `getRequestContext` / `getTraceId` / `setRequestUser`
  / `setRequestError` — a per-request `AsyncLocalStorage` context.
- W3C Trace Context — `resolveTraceContext` / `parseTraceparent` /
  `formatTraceparent` / `childSpan`.
- `sanitizePayload` / `redact` / `truncatePreview` / `measureSize` — mask
  secret-named keys, drop binary blobs, cap payload size.

### Client & React

- `createClient()` / `createClients()` / `createHttpClient()` — a typed fetch
  client built from contracts (Ky-based, SSR cookies, error parsing).
- `createCursorQuery()` — the canonical cursor-paginated infinite query, built
  on `react-query-kit`.
- `createSocketIOClient()` / `createSocketIOServer()` — typed Socket.IO
  wrappers with durable subscriptions.
- `createCacheBridge()` — sync socket events into the TanStack Query cache;
  transport-agnostic.
